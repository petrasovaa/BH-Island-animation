# BH Island animation
This repository contains animation of Bold Head Island and scripts for creating the animation.
The animation is in the form of reveal.js presentation which runs in a web browser. We use Raspberry Pie computer to run it.

The 3D model is a digital elevation model (bare earth) of BH Island for 2014. The dashed line symbolizes the coastline from lates 2014 data. The model is 10 vertically exaggerated. The roads and houses are from 2016.

1. Connect the computer with the projector and plug in the computer and the projector in a power plug. Switch on the projector. Plug in mouse.
2. The operating system will boot and then the desktop appears. Open the directory `presentation` on the desktop and double-click on `island.html`. A browser window appears.
3. Check if keystone should be corrected (use projector remote buttons).
3. Move the browser to the top of the screen and use mouse to resize the window to match the model. To make it easier, use the slide advancer to stop the animation (by pressing key < or >) and set 2014 which matches the model. Try to match the coastline and the rivers in the inner part of the island. Make sure the peojector is focused.
4. Use the slide advancer to step through the animation, or press the presentation button (bottom left) one or two times to start the automatic loop.
5. When finished, switch off the projector (press the switch-off button twice). The computer will continue running and when the projector is switched on again, the presentation will appear.
